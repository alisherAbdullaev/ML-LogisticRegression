# This project provides an implementation of logistic regression algorithm. It supports an arbitary number of feature inputs and accepts un-encoded class labels.

### LogReg.py

* The constructor ` __init__() ` takes parameter **self** that will be an instatnce of the LogReg class. The **X** and **y** parameters will store the training data and function, and `NLL()` calculates and returns the negative log-likelihood score for a proposed model. 

* Method `predict_proba()` calculates and returns 1D array with the predicted probabilities on a scale from 0 to 1 and where the number of entries equal to the number of rows in **X**.

* Method `predict()` returns the predicted class with the threshold being equal to 0.5.

* Method `score()` calculates and returns the training accuracy.

* Method `summary()` prints out the message with number of observations, best coeffecient estimates, Log-Likelihood, and accuracy.

* Method `precision_recall()` calculates and prints out the calculated precisions and recall to tell us more about the model.

### Testing.ipynb

* This jupyter notebook provides some examples with three different datasets.

### ClassificationPlotter.py

This python file helps to visualize the data points for the first dataset.
